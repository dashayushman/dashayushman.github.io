# **Who am I?**

I am a fast learner, hard worker, and a self-motivated independent developer. I have an affinity towards Artificial Intelligence (specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning) and I aim at contributing as much as I can to these fields. My research interests are Sequence Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks, Sequence to Sequence Models, Siamese Network, Natural Language Understanding using Deep Learning, and Handwriting Recognition in Air. Apart from my interests in AI I have a keen interest in Web Application development.

# **Recent Work**

My recent scientific contributions are AirScript, a novel approach for writing in air, and TAC-GAN a Generative Adversarial Network for generating text to Image (in this work we introduce a method for indirect information augmentation).

# **Work History**

Currently, I am a student at the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany, and I work at Insiders Technologies GmbH as a Research Assistant. At Insiders, I work in the Natural Language Understanding team and I am involved in developing a Deep Question Answering model for real-world business use cases. Apart from that, I have been involved in developing a Deep Neural Network Model for fraud detection.

In Germany, I have also worked at Deutsche Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz GmbH (DFKI) in their Multimedia Opinion Mining team. I have also worked in the Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction Department at the University of Kaiserslautern, in a project with Volkswagen for developing/maintaining a GUI for Quality Assurance of automobile parts.

In India, I have worked as a Software Engineer at a startup called Reverie Language Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Being a part of a start-up I not just gained the experience of being a full stack developer but, I learned to work like a family and solve real life problems. Before Joining Reverie, I underwent training as an Assistant Software Engineer Trainee at Tata Consultancy Services Limited.
