# **Introduction**

If you are too frustrated with your theoretical knowledge on <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and you are looking for a good starting point to burst your bubble and take a leap, then you are at the right place. I will use this blog to share my experience with Machine Learning and use it to classify hand gestures using data from <strong>Myo Armband</strong>. This is my initiative to spread knowledge about Machine Learning and how to use the available toolkits to solve real world problems. In this blog, I will cover my research topic and at the same time, I will try to put up solutions to all the problems that I faced when I entered the world of Machine Learning.

We will start off with an introduction to my research topic and a few tips before we get our hands dirty.


## **The following are a few things that might be handy:**
1. **Programming Experience**: Preferably in python but any other programming language would do as well. (I learnt Python directly by using it as per need. I believe that it is a good way to learn as well, but, I recommend going through the basics and rest will be taken care of by some hands-on experience.)

2. **Some idea about Machine Learning: **An introductory course would also work fine. Please refer to the references below to navigate to some really good sources that I find interesting and easy to pick up.

3. **Self-Motivation and Patience: **These are really important, as you need to have a lot of patience and self-motivation to solve real world problems and they are not easy to solve.

4. **Hunger for Knowledge:** You might get overwhelmed by many mathematical derivations and formulas, but have patience and hang in there. Understanding comes from repetition. There are enough resources available on the internet. You are just one Google Search away from the solution to your problem. Be deligent and hungry to learn.

## **The following are a few tools that I use and will use here:**
1. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>
4. <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">Scikit-Learn</a>
5. <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank">Numpy</a>
6. <a href="http://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>

<em>I will keep updating this list as there are many tools (<strong>all free</strong>) that I will use for demonstrating my research project and a lot of other cool stuff too.</em>
